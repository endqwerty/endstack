# Technical writing

Write so a tired engineer understands on the first read. Apply all four layers.

Three rules sit above the layers:

- **Cut every word that does no work.** If the sentence survives without a word, the word goes. "In order to" is "to". "It is important to note that" is nothing.
- **Use the short, everyday word.** "Use", not "utilize". "Help", not "facilitate". "Do", not "perform". A long word has to buy its length with precision.
- **When a rule makes a sentence worse, fix the sentence another way or leave it alone.** A sentence that follows every rule and sounds like a machine wrote it has failed.

The codebase is the word list. Write the real symbol, file, flag, or command name, not a synonym or a description of it.

Don't invent jargon. Use the words a developer would say out loud: "move", "delete", "a budget that only decreases", not "evacuate", "ratchet", or "endgame". A named pattern is fine when the doc says what it means the first time. Propose a new offender and its replacement as an addition to `unslop`'s abstract-metaphor rule in your reply, with the diff. Don't edit that skill.

## Keep the goal visible

On the first task message, restate the user's goal and problem in your own words and, for a change, the smallest expected solution. Proceed without waiting for confirmation. Carry the goal into each delegated brief, the opening of the pull request's rationale, and the final report. Skip the final restatement for a fully specified one-line edit. If evidence rules out the requested change, show it and stop.

## Vary the rhythm

A doc can obey every layer and still read machine-written: every sentence clipped short, no view anywhere, nothing specific.

- Mix sentence lengths on purpose. Short sentences land a point. Longer ones carry a fact with its condition or consequence.
- One thought per sentence does not mean one length per sentence. Split the sentence that carries two thoughts. Keep the long sentence that carries one.
- Have a view where the mode allows it. Explanation weighs trade-offs, so say what you make of them instead of listing pros and cons. Reference stays dry.
- Be specific over sterile. Not "schema changes can cause issues" but "a column rename fails the build".

## Apply the four layers

Before writing or reviewing, read [the four style layers](references/style-layers.md): Diátaxis document modes, developer-style sentences, STE instructions, and Global English syntax. Apply all four. PR descriptions and commit messages skip only the document-mode layer.

## Voice and repo specifics

- Apply the [unslop](../unslop/SKILL.md) skill to every doc this skill touches. That skill owns the slop-pattern catalog: AI vocabulary, filler, hedging, formatting tells.
- PR descriptions and commit messages are writing too. Every layer except Diátaxis applies to them. A PR body is a briefing that a reviewer can read in under a minute. Do not paste swarm logs, SHA lists, or metric tables. Link them.
- Product UI strings are not documentation. Use your product's copy guidelines for those.
- Indent code snippets with tabs. Write real paths. Make every count or tree claim true at the commit that lands it, and include the reproducible procedure that regenerates it.

## Worked example

Before:

> Configuration of the proto import ratchet budget script parameters is performed via budget.json. Note that it's important to remember that running with --write, which updates the committed budget to reflect the current count, should only be done when lowering it. If exceeded, CI fails.

After:

> `budget.mjs` reads the committed budget from `budget.json` and counts the files that import protos. If the count exceeds the budget, CI fails. Use the budget updater only to lower the budget.
